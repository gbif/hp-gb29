## Travel requirements for entering Belgium
GB29 participants are responsible for arranging their own travel and to ensure that they have the documentation required for entering Belgium [(Schengen area)](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en). 

### Schengen Visa and Passport requirements
If you are a [non-EU national](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm) wishing to visit or travel within the EU, you will need a passport: 
- valid for at least 3 months after the date you intend to leave the EU country you are visiting, 
- which was issued within the previous 10 years,
and possibly a visa. You should apply for a visa from the [consulate or embassy](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/embassies/index_en.htm) of the country you are visiting [(Belgium)](https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/embassies-and-consulates). If your visa is from a [Schengen area country](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en), it automatically allows you to travel to the other Schengen countries as well. If you have a valid residence permit from one of the Schengen countries, it is equivalent to a visa. You may need a national visa to visit non-Schengen countries.  

Border officials in EU countries may ask for other supporting documents such as an invitation letter, proof of lodging, return or round-trip ticket. For the precise requirements, please contact the [local consular services](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/embassies/index_en.htm) of the EU country in question.  

There are a [number of countries](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1806#d1e32-54-1) whose nationals do not need a visa to visit the EU for three months or less. The list of countries whose nationals require visas to travel to Belgium differs slightly from other EU countries.
 
You can find information on entering Belgium on website of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Belgium: https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/travel_to_belgium

If a visa is required, make sure to apply well in advance of the meeting. Also, if you require an official letter of invitation for visa puposes, please contact the Secretariat at [GB29@gbif.org](mailto:GB29@gbif.org).

## Arriving in Bruxelles

Right in the heart of Europe, Brussels has superb air, road and rail connections.  

More than 60 million Europeans live within 300 km of Brussels, less than two hours by high-speed train. For those who fly in, it takes only 20 minutes from the airport to the city centre. And when you have arrived, it's easy to move around the compact city, by public transport or on foot. [More info!](https://visit.brussels/en/article/Getting-to-Brussels)

### Brussels by train
[Brussels South railway station](https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Stations/Brussels-Midi) is the major hub for international trains ([Thalys](https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/Thalys), [Eurostar](https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/Eurostar), [TGV Brussels-France](https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/TGV-Brussels-France), [ICE](https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/ICE), [InterCity](https://www.b-europe.com/EN/Trains/InterCity)) and can be a comfortable and durable transport solution for people coming from near European countries.  

### Brussels by plane

#### Brussels Airport  (BRU) 
[Brussels Airport](https://www.brusselsairport.be/en/our-airport/about-brussels-airport) is the main international plane transit point of Belgium. It is located North of Brussels. 

Bus services:  
From the airport the city centre can be reached by [bus](https://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passengers/access-parking/bus/public-bustransport). It is suggested to take bus 12 from STIB and then off of at the [Trône station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Troon/@50.8412946,4.3643728,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c3c484669466a5:0x4681f9f07f2903dc!8m2!3d50.8412946!4d4.3665615).

Train services:  
From the airport the city centre can also be reached by [train](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/airports/brussels-airport). 

There is a direct train that runs from [Brussels Airport – Zaventem station](https://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passengers/access-parking/train) to the city centre of Brussels (station Brussels-Central) every 10 minutes practically 24/7. Tickets cost just 12.70€ ([diabolo tax](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/airports/diabolo-fee) included) one-way and the journey takes 17 minutes. Buy your ticket at the Brussels Airport train station.

Taxi:

More information on taxi sercies is available [here](https://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passengers/access-parking/taxi-and-limousine-services).

#### Brussels South Charleroi Airport (CRL)
[Brussels-South Charleroi Airport](https://www.brussels-charleroi-airport.com/en/flights/live), the second busiest airport in Belgium is located in Gosselies, South of Brussels). Going to Brussels City centre by public transport is a burden. We suggest to take the [Flibco](https://www.flibco.com/en) bus to Brussels Midi, which leaves every 20 minutes.

#### Schiphol, the Netherlands  (AMS)  
From [Schiphol Airport](https://www.schiphol.nl/en/) it is fairly easy to take a train to Brussels. Fast trains between Schiphol and Brussels need upfront reservation.

## Getting around in Brussels
Brussels is very simple to navigate and easily accessible. If you want to travel around the capital, choose soft mobility and public transport over the car. Traffic in the city is heavy, so you can often get around more quickly by public transport, bicycle or even electric scooter.
[More info!](https://visit.brussels/site/en/article/transport-in-brussels)  

Whether your journey takes you to Trône or to the Brussels South train station, public transportation will allow you to easily reach the European district where the conference and the suggested hotels are located (metro 2 and 6, bus 71).  

Different formulas for Brussels public transports can be found [here](https://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?l=en&_guid=f06631b4-33f1-3910-2a8c-988f71b287a7).

## General information

### Electricity
Check [here](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/belgium/) if you need a power plug travel adapter? In Belgium, types C, F and E are the official standards, and operates on a 230V supply voltage and 50Hz.  

### Health
Check [www.info-coronavirus.be/en/travels/](https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/travels/) for updates of the rules linked to COVID-19 and traveling to Belgium. 


### Languages
Belgium is a small country, but encompasses 3 communities using distinct languages : Dutch (Flemish community), French (French community), German (Germanish community). Most residents in Belgium can understand English and will be happy to help if needed.  

### Money
Belgium is considered the heart of the European union. The country is a world leader in financial services and has the highest rate of card payments in the world. For your trip to Belgium, you will need a product that lets you spend euros minus the extra international transaction fees. While it is true that the majority of payments in Belgium are made with cards, it is always a good idea to have some Euro cash. You will find some smaller vendors that only accept cash. 

Travel money guide: [Belgium](https://www.finder.com/travel-money/belgium)

Currency: € (Euro’s)

Almost all shops accept cash, credit cards and debit cards (Maestro cards).

### Opening hours (for banks and shops)
Most shops will open from 8.00-20.00, varying depending on the type of commerce.  
Banks usually have shorter and more variable opening hours, but offer 24-hour access to ATMs.

### Personal security
It is always good to know these two urgency phone number when in belgium: 
- 112:Emergency medical assistance and fire services
- 101: urgent police assistance

The everlasting question of all tourists once they decide to visit a certain city is whether it is safe or dangerous. All in all, Brussels is considered a safe city with a safety score of 60%. 

When the risk of using taxis in Brussels is concerned, there is a constant possibility of being overcharged or driven around the city. Licensed taxis are always a better solution. You should be vigilant when in public transport because pickpockets or bag snatchers might happen to be there.  

Unfortunately, Brussels is considered one of the top capital cities where pickpocket risk is at a very high level. The whole of Belgium is believed to be unsafe regarding thieves, especially at train stations and subways.

### Tips and service gratuities (rules for tipping)
Tipping is not standard in Belgium. Bills do usually include the service charge. Service staff in Belgium do not rely on tips to make up their income. Leaving a tip for cab, restaurants and other services is a welcomed but not mandatory gesture.

### Weather
In the month of October, maximum temperature is 16°C and minimum temperature is 9°C (for an average temperature of 13°C). The climate is relatively cool in that area in October, but it is bearable by dressing cosy. With 79 mm over 5 days, rain may occur during your stay, with only temporary showers.
