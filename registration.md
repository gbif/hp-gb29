## GBIF committee meetings

## GBIF Governing Board meeting

For the Governing Board meeting, only Heads of Delegation, committee members and invited observers can register. 

Heads of Delegation are asked to nominate any additional delegates to join the meeting. Heads of Delegation may nominate up to two additional delegates, and are recommended to include the Node Manager as part of the delegation. If you are a member of a delegation and wish to attend as such, please contact your Head of Delegation about being included in the registration. 

Like in previous years, we also offer the opportunity for the delegation to include up to two observers (virtual attendance only). Delegation observers cannot take the floor. 

Please note that in case the Head of Delegation is not able to attend all sessions due to time zone difficulties, provision will be made to ensure that all delegats can vieew recordings of the proceedings in their own time. 

For the **GBIF committee meetings**, only members (Budget, Executive and Science Committees and the Nodes Steering Group) can register for the meetings.


Please note that your registration is not considered complete until you receive a confirmation email from the GBIF Secretariat.
