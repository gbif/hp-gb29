    The Belgian Biodiversity Platform and the Belgian Science Policy, on behalf of Belgium, are pleased to host the 29th meeting (GB29) of the GBIF Governing Board in Brussels. 
    
    The following events will take place:
    2 October 2022 - GBIF committee meetings
    3-5 October 2022 - Official Governing Board meeting
    6 October 2022 - Data Beyond Borders, Biodivesa+/GBIF joint symposium
    
    After two years of virtual meetings, we look forward to welcoming all the delegates in Brussels. This will be the first ever hybrid GBIF Governing Board meeting. We will be delighted if you can attend in person, but if you cannot make it, you also have the opportunity to particpate remotely. If you are coming to Brussels, you will have the opportunity to attend the side events.
